/*
This helper function makes a group of elements animate along the x-axis in a seamless, responsive loop.

Features:
- Uses xPercent so that even if the widths change (like if the window gets resized), it should still work in most cases.
- When each item animates to the left or right enough, it will loop back to the other side
- Optionally pass in a config object with values like "speed" (default: 1, which travels at roughly 100 pixels per second), paused (boolean),  repeat, reversed, and paddingRight.
- The returned timeline will have the following methods added to it:
- next() - animates to the next element using a timeline.tweenTo() which it returns. You can pass in a vars object to control duration, easing, etc.
- previous() - animates to the previous element using a timeline.tweenTo() which it returns. You can pass in a vars object to control duration, easing, etc.
- toIndex() - pass in a zero-based index value of the element that it should animate to, and optionally pass in a vars object to control duration, easing, etc. Always goes in the shortest direction
- current() - returns the current index (if an animation is in-progress, it reflects the final index)
- times - an Array of the times on the timeline where each element hits the "starting" spot. There's also a label added accordingly, so "label1" is when the 2nd element reaches the start.
